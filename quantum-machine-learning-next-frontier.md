Should the findings of the South Korean physics researchers be verified, a significant physics discovery of our era may have occurred. The potential superconductors that function at ambient pressure and room temperatures might fundamentally change the qubit's role in quantum computing. This change could aid in scalability, although higher temperatures can still affect quantum inaccuracies. Nevertheless, room temperature superconductors represent a crucial element of the quantum conundrum, simplifying the creation of hybrid systems capable of alternating between classical and quantum computation tasks.

In the future, it might be feasible that quantum hardware and software will collaborate seamlessly with their classical counterparts, concentrating on calculations tailor-made for optimization challenges. Within the realms of machine learning and deep learning, this synergy could transform conventional AI paradigms.

Many quantum algorithms that have achieved exponential accelerations have done so through clever approaches applied to problems with explicit objectives, confirmable outcomes, and well thought out strategies toward a solution. In contrast to traditional machine learning methods, quantum algorithms will harness the unique characteristics of superposition, entanglement, and interference to discover alternative solutions where conventional computers falter. To understand how quantum technology could be applied to something like neural networks, we need to take a pause and start at square one.


What are qubits and gates?

In order to make this approachable, I will explain these concepts using an analogy.

Imagine the bits() of a classical computer as a simple light switch in your home; they are either in the OFF (0) or ON (1) position. In the world of regular computing, this binary system forms the foundation of all operations.

Now, picture a qubit as a dimmer switch instead of a simple light switch. The dimmer switch not only has an ON and OFF position but also various stages in between, allowing for a wide range of light levels. This is a lot like how qubits work. They can represent not just 0 or 1 but also a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This ability to be in multiple states at once allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information simultaneously, leading to potentially enormous computational power.





With the limitations of near-term quantum hardware potentially being a thing of the past soon as physics research advances, tthe maturity of classical algorithms is another matter that quantum algorithms will need to address. 

Let's walk through an example. I have the make moons dataset and BLANK BLANK BLANK.
