# Hi, I'm Christian

I’m a data scientist focused on applied natural language processing. My professional background covers a wide range of projects, from one-off analyses and applied research to building AI driven software.

My expertise in AI, machine learning, and NLP lie at the convergence of my interest in neuroscience and psychology.

I'm currently working on understanding how transformers develop an internal model of theory of mind. This line of research sits within mechanistic interpretability, where I’m exploring how we can break open transformers to reverse-engineer how they represent and reason about mental states.

Outside of my work, I'm probably traveling, making music, playing sports, or occasionally tossing around yo-yos.
