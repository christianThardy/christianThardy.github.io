# Hi, I'm Christian

I'm an ai engineer focused on building ai agents, LLM pipelines and evals. Formerly a data scientist focused on applied natural language processing and machine learning, where my professional background has covered a wide range of projects, from one-off analyses and applied research to building AI driven software.

My work lies at the convergence of my interest in neuroscience and psychology. I'm currently interested in understanding how transformer algorithms reason and develop internal models of theory of mind.

Outside of my work, I'm probably traveling, making music or occasionally tossing around yo-yos.
