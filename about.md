# Hi, I'm Christian

I’m a data scientist specializing in applied natural language processing, with a professional background that covers a variety of projects. From one-off analyses and applied research to the development of software to guide business leaders with AI-based solutions.

My expertise in AI, machine learning, and NLP lie at the convergence of my interest in neuroscience and psychology.

Lately, my focus has been on independent interpretability research, specifically on understanding how neural networks model theory of mind. This line of research sits within mechanistic interpretability, where I’m investigating how neural networks can be analyzed to decode their *reasoning* about the beliefs, desires, and intentions of others. 

Outside of my work, I love traveling, making music, sports, and occasionally tossing around a yo-yo.
