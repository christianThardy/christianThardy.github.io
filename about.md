# Hi, I'm Christian

Iâ€™m a data scientist focused on applied natural language processing. My professional background covers a wide range of projects, from one-off analyses and applied research to building AI driven software.

My knowledge of AI, machine learning, and NLP lie at the convergence of my interest in neuroscience and psychology.

Sitting within the field of mechanistic interpretability, I'm currently working on understanding how transformers develop internal models of theories of mind, to reverse-engineer how they represent and *reason* about mental states.

Outside of my work, I'm probably traveling, making music, playing sports, or occasionally tossing around yo-yos.
